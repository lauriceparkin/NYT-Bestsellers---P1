Working Title: Judge a Book
 Description: This app gives the user the ability to search the Book Best Seller Database of The New York Times based on date. It features a clean and minimal interface with an engaging photograph providing a backdrop for boxes of text featuring Helvetica which conveys a strong, modern interface. It’s a simple set-up allowing the user to explore the literary, cultural zeitgeist based on what books were at the top of the charts in the last decade. 

API: Book API from The New York Times.

Goals: To have a working app to search The NY Times Book Seller List using a a clean, easy to use interface returning interesting data for personal or research purposes. Make the interface visually pleasing by using hover elements on clickable items. Version 1 will not include the ability to click and buy, however, a link will be provided for the user to locate a bookstore near them.

Version 2.0 Goals: 
• Use more elements of searching i.e. category (fiction, non-fiction, etc).
• Add a feature that displays a description of the book upon hovering over the image.
• Add a feature that allows the image to be clickable to either purchase the book or read the review in the Times.
