  <p class="about">This project is a tiny homage to my love of books as well as book cover art. Hopefully, a glimpse
    into
    the bestseller list provides a unique view of the literary and cultural zeitgeist of the time. And, many covers to
    judge.<br></br>If you're
    interested in
    purchasing any of the books you see, please buy local and support independent booksellers. You can find your
    nearest bookstore by clicking <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/indie-bookstore-finder"
      style="color:rgb(194, 68, 14);">here</a>.
